My static website is for an animal shelter called 'Hope Animal Shelter'.

We need 5 seperate pages:

1. index.html - when you click the link, the first page that shows with the events
2. fundraiser.html - on the landing page (index.html) go to the upcoming events,
the first event (fundraiser), click the button and it will take you to that page
3. ourhopeanimals.html - on the navbar, shows the available animals
4. volunteerform.html - on navbar - FORM (meets Technical Component #9)
The form is fully function and will send the results to an email i've created
5. adoptionform.html - on navbar - FORM (meets Technical Component #9)
The form is fully function and will send the results to an email i've created

#2 Technical requirement, includes a favicon - see each of the five html files.

Header on all pages, links (index.html and fundraiser.html page), images on all pages
Two different fonts, and files placed in appropriate folders., different layouts on all pages
