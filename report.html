**My "MashApp" Is just a continuation of Hope Animal Shelter Website
**Links to https://clairejohn.github.io/HopeAnimalShelter/

1. What my app does
This app is supposed to help Hope Animal Shelter collect adoption and volunteer information and
present information to users in a clean, and fun way.

2. How assignment satisfies assignment's requirements
    1. Deploy site publically (github or stu)
      * My site is deployed on github.io. The link is above
    2. is responsive
      * When I tested the website it is viewable via a phone app
    3. 
      * Uses two different APIs. The first one is the Audio API. I was able to use the built in API/Functions such as play
    4. 
      * Has some kind of search; My app has a search bar. While it is not very functional it is ok
      * It has some capability on 'our hope animals' page
    5. !display results - this does not work and therefore does not satisfy this requirement
    6. !results are filterable - there is a filter button but it does not work very well
